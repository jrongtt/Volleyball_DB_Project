# Volleyball_DB_Project
Java + SQL Volleyball Database Project


This is a Java Oracle Project that upon running the SQL DDL file 'Volleyball.sql' creates a 
volleyball database with 20+ tables and inserts 100+ tuples into that database.

After running this DDL file a Java Swing user-interface can be rendered by running the 'Volleyball.java' file in the Controller folder

The interface allows for a user to update, delete, and query information about the database.

An ER diagram representing the Database can be viewed in the attachment 'ER_Diagram.png'
